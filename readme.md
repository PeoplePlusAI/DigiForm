**This readme.md file on your project's github repository acts as a landing page for your project. We have provided a template for it below. All text in *italics* is custom to your project and will need to be updated for each working group. The project anchor is responsible for the Github repository, accessibility settings for project team, design and maintenance.**

**The readme.md will have a section acting as an index for your project documents. All project documents should be stored in ONE Google Drive that you as project anchor manage and should have the correct accessibility setting [i.e. Anyone with the link should be able to comment on the document]. This section should be arranged in an index format and your Google Drive documents should be linked there -- see template section below for reference**
